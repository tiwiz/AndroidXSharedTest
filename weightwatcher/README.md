# Weight Watcher Exercise

This poorly written app serves as a base for refactoring purposes.

# Tasks

- Refactor the repository so that it can be tested
- Refactor `MainActivity`  so that it can be tested with Espresso
- Rewrite the logic inside the `WeightRecordActivity` so that it can be maintained properly

## Tips

- You might want to use a database in order to store the data, so that it can be better managed
- The UI in the `WeightRecordActivity` is really poor and messy, what about a nice clean up?
